## The Power of Book API
1. Efficiency: Using maps for in-memory storage makes CRUD operations (especially searches) very fast (O(1)), much better than brute-force slice iteration.

2. Concurrency Safety: Using sync.Mutex ensures data doesn't get corrupted if many API requests come in simultaneously.

3. Clean Structure: By separating code into models, services, and handlers, your project is cleaner, more readable, and easier to maintain or expand in the future.

4. Powerful Router: Leveraging Gin Gonic makes routing concise, and features like path parameters (:id) and JSON binding (c.BindJSON) greatly simplify development.

5. Clear Error Handling: Your API provides informative error responses (400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error) to clients, which is essential for debugging client applications.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Go installed. If not, install it from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/).
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the project with:
